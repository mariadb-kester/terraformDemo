## Using the infrastructure

Now that the infrastructure is created you will be able to check this on the [DigitalOcean Website](https://www.digitalocean.com).

On the dashboard, find Kubernetes on the left hand side menu. You will find the Kubernetes Cluster that you have just
built:

and, if you find the Container Registry menu option, you will find the second item that we built. This is a private
Container Registry that we will use to hold your containers that will be deployed to this infrastructure.

You can now return to the script and answer the prompt with a `y`.
